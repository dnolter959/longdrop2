# longdrop2

## Overview

This package implements a statistical method proposed by Moreno-Betancur and Chavance in their 2013 [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0962280213490014), which facilitates sensitivity analyses of Mixed Model results to various departures from the Missing at Random (MAR) assumption, in the presence of drop-out.  

## Description

Mixed Models are commonly used to make inference in the longitudinal setting. In the event of study drop-out, one must proceed to characterize whether data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), or Missing Not at Random (MNAR). In the event that data is MCAR or MAR, no adjustments need to be made and one may interpret fixed effects in the same way as if there was no missingness; this does not hold in the case of MNAR. 

A fundamental problem is that there is no way to know for sure whether data is MNAR or MAR; and so it is common to proceed to conduct a sensitivity analysis which assumes MNAR in a variety of ways, and compares these results to those assuming MAR.

This package facilitates conducting such sensitivity analyses by allowing a user to specify departures from the MAR assumption by choosing multiple values of k, each of which characterizes the distributional differences between the observed and missing outcomes via an affine shift. Using these values of k, the package allows the user to perform multiple imputation (the user can specify the number of random imputations by passing an M parameter, the default is 20), and then combine results using Rubin's rules as specified in the original Moreno-Betancur and Chavance paper linked above. 

The user can then plot results across sensible values of k (k=0 represents the MAR case) to observe sensitivity of effects to departures from the MAR assumption.

## Installation

You can install the development version of longdrop2 like so:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dnolter959/longdrop2")
```

## Example

```{r eval=F}
library(longdrop2)
MAR_model = lmer(outcome ~ arm + week + arm*week + (1 + week | uid), data = data)
time_var = "week"
idx_of_coef_of_interest = 4
K = c(-20, -15, -10, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 15, 20)
M = 20

ld = longdrop(MAR_model, time_var, idx_of_coef_of_interest, K, M)
```

In this setting a user has a dataset called `data`. 

- They first fit a MAR model using the `lmer` function from the `lme4` package
- Then they specify:
  - The time variable, 
  - The index of the coefficient of interest (in this case it is 4 because the user is interested in the coefficient on the interaction term)
  - A set, K, of k values to test
  - M, the number of random samples imputed)

The `longdrop` function returns a `hash` object with inferential results for each value of k (point estimate, 95% CI, standard errors, p-value)

If the user calls `plot` on the longdrop object, they can see a plot of the effect size of interest and associated confidence intervals for each value of k. 

```{r, eval=F}
plot(ld)
```

In this case, the treatment effect doesn't differ much for different values of k, suggesting low sensitivity to departures from MAR in this case.
